# Kubernetes


## Lab â€“ Upgrading a Kubernetes cluster with kubeadm upgrade

The Kubernetes maintainers keep to a one-per-quarter (every three months) release cycle for minor versions, with each
branch receiving maintenance for 9 months after release.

`kubeadm upgrade` is a user-friendly command that performs all of the necessary tasks needed to upgrade or downgrade a
Kubernetes cluster to another minor release version in one command. It has subcommands for both planning an upgrade and
actually performing it.


### Objectives

- Understand the upgrade planning process
- Learn about the version compatibility between kubernetes control plane components
- Upgrade a kubeadm cluster to a newer a minor version


### 1. Prepare a new Kubernetes Cluster with Kubeadm

Get the version of your Kubernetes cluster with `kubectl version`:

```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$ kubectl version

Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"16", GitVersion:"v1.16.4", GitCommit:"224be7bdce5a9dd0c2fd0d46b83865648e2fe0ba", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2019-12-11T12:47:40Z", GoVersion:"go1.12.12", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"16", GitVersion:"v1.16.4", GitCommit:"224be7bdce5a9dd0c2fd0d46b83865648e2fe0ba", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2019-12-11T12:37:43Z", GoVersion:"go1.12.12", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}

ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$
```

The Kubernetes client version indicates the Kubeadm version being used to invoke the command, while the Server version
reports the current control plane's version as reported by the kubelet.

Check what version is being reported to the Kubernetes api server by your node's kubelet:

```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$ kubectl get nodes

NAME              STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
ip-172-31-12-52   Ready    master   27h     v1.16.4

ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$
```

You can check the version of a nodes kubelet by running the `kubelet` command. Since the kubelet was installed as a
systemd daemon, you will need to use sudo:

```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$ sudo kubelet --version

Kubernetes v1.16.4

ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$
```


### 2. Selecting the version to upgrade to

Before executing a cluster upgrade, there are several things to take into account.

The biggest consideration for picking a new version is whether the control plane components are compatible with the
kube-apiserver version you intend to upgrade to. This policy is known as the version skew policy:

Components | Can be older than kube-apiserver | Can be newer than kube-apiserver
-------- | --------------- | ---------
Other kube-apiservers in a HA cluster | Up to 1 minor version | No
kubelet | Up to 2 minor versions| No
kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler, cloud-controller-manager | Up to 1 minor version | No
kubectl | Up to 1 minor version | Up to 1 minor version

So if you are running a Kubernetes cluster at version 1.17, the compatibility matrix would look like this:

Components | Compatible versions
---- | ----
Other kube-apiservers | 1.16, 1.17
kubelet | 1.15, 1.16, 1.17
kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler, cloud-controller-manager | 1.16, 1.17

If there are multiple instances of kube-apiserver in a highly available and load-balanced cluster, then the
compatibility should be restricted to the oldest instance of kube-apiserver that is running in that HA cluster.


### 3. Acquire the new version binaries

Before you can upgrade your Kubernetes cluster, you must retrieve the binaries for the version of Kubernetes you intend
to upgrade to.

If you followed the Ubuntu installation instructions from Kubernetes (either from a previous lab in this course or the
Kubernetes documentation), you will simply need to update the Kubernetes apt repository and use `apt install` to apply
the desired versions of the Kubernetes components for the upgrade.

Start by updating the apt repository on your VM:

```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$ sudo apt update

Hit:1 http://us-west-1.ec2.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial InRelease

41 packages can be upgraded. Run 'apt list --upgradable' to see them.

ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$
```

Now check the available packages:

```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$ apt-cache policy kubeadm | head -20

kubeadm:
  Installed: 1.17.2-00
  Candidate: 1.17.2-00
  Version table:
 *** 1.17.2-00 500
        500 http://apt.kubernetes.io kubernetes-xenial/main amd64 Packages
        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status
     1.17.1-00 500
        500 http://apt.kubernetes.io kubernetes-xenial/main amd64 Packages

        500 http://apt.kubernetes.io kubernetes-xenial/main amd64 Packages
     1.16.6-00 500
        500 http://apt.kubernetes.io kubernetes-xenial/main amd64 Packages
     1.16.5-00 500
        500 http://apt.kubernetes.io kubernetes-xenial/main amd64 Packages
     1.16.4-00 500
        500 http://apt.kubernetes.io kubernetes-xenial/main amd64 Packages
     1.16.3-00 500
        500 http://apt.kubernetes.io kubernetes-xenial/main amd64 Packages
     1.16.2-00 500

ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$
```

You should presented with the opportunity to update to the latest version of kubeadm. The only condition to
selecting an upgrade version is that it is within one minor release of the version you are on.

This means you can go from version 1.16 to 1.17, but you will not be able to go to 1.15 directly to 1.17. In order to
upgrade to 1.17 from 1.15, you will need to upgrade to 1.16 first.

Pick the kubeadm version at the top of the apt-cache list and install it:

```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$ sudo apt install kubeadm=1.17.2-00

Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
kubeadm is already the newest version (1.17.2-00).
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 41 not upgraded.

ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$
```

Check the version of kubeadm:

```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$ kubeadm version

kubeadm version: &version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"17", GitVersion:"v1.17.2", GitCommit:"59603c6e503c87169aea6106f57b9f242f64df89", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2020-01-18T23:27:49Z", GoVersion:"go1.13.5", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}

ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$
```

Your kubeadm is now ready to perform the latest update.


### 4. Using kubeadm upgrade

The `upgrade` subcommand for `kubectl` is what you will be using to upgrade your Kubernetes cluster.

In your terminal, show the help for it using the `--help` flag:

```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$ kubeadm upgrade --help

Upgrade your cluster smoothly to a newer version with this command

Usage:
  kubeadm upgrade [flags]
  kubeadm upgrade [command]

Available Commands:
  apply       Upgrade your Kubernetes cluster to the specified version
  diff        Show what differences would be applied to existing static pod manifests. See also: kubeadm upgrade apply --dry-run
  node        Upgrade commands for a node in the cluster
  plan        Check which versions are available to upgrade to and validate whether your current cluster is upgradeable. To skip the internet check, pass in the optional [version] parameter

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for upgrade

Global Flags:
      --add-dir-header           If true, adds the file directory to the header
      --log-file string          If non-empty, use this log file
      --log-file-max-size uint   Defines the maximum size a log file can grow to. Unit is megabytes. If the value is 0, the maximum file size is unlimited. (default 1800)
      --rootfs string            [EXPERIMENTAL] The path to the 'real' host root filesystem.
      --skip-headers             If true, avoid header prefixes in the log messages
      --skip-log-headers         If true, avoid headers when opening log files
  -v, --v Level                  number for the log level verbosity

Use "kubeadm upgrade [command] --help" for more information about a command.

ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$
```

Of note here is the `plan` subcommand for `kubectl upgrade`, which will essentially perform a dry-run of the preflight
checks and inform you whether the cluster is upgradable or not.

Run `kubeadm upgrade plan` with `sudo` and see if your cluster is ready for an upgrade:

```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$ sudo kubeadm upgrade plan

In this run, `kubeadm upgrade plan` has provided two options:

- Upgrade to the latest patch version available for Kubernetes 1.17
- Upgrade to the next minor version, Kubernetes 1.16.6

These recommendations will differ based on what versions of Kubernetes are available. You are also advised as to which components of the cluster need to be updated manually after `kubeadm upgrade`.


### 5. Upgrade the cluster

After deciding which version to upgrade the cluster to, use one of the suggested `kubeadm upgrade apply` commands given
by `kubectl upgrade plan` above.

`kubeadm upgrade apply` will perform the following:

- Checks that the cluster's API server can be reached
- Ensures that all nodes are in the `Ready` state
- The control plane components are reporting `Healthy` status
- Ensures that the new versions of the control plane components abide by the version skew policy
- Makes sure the control plane images can be pulled for the update
- Updates control plane pods and restarts them (or rolls them back if any of them fails to come up).
- Applies the new `kube-dns` and `kube-proxy` manifests and makes sure that all necessary RBAC rules are created.
- Creates new certificate and key files of the API server and backs up old files (if theyâ€™re about to expire in 180 days).

In this case, we will upgrade to the latest patch version of the next minor version, 1.17.2 (as of this writing):

```

```

After the operation finishes, check the version of the cluster with kubectl:

```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$ kubectl version

Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"16", GitVersion:"v1.16.4", GitCommit:"224be7bdce5a9dd0c2fd0d46b83865648e2fe0ba", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2019-12-11T12:47:40Z", GoVersion:"go1.12.12", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}

ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$
```

Our server version refers to the api-server version. We see that it is now running at version 1.17.2.

Check the control plane pods and see if they have been updated; they should be seconds or minutes old:

```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system

NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$
```

The coredns pods, and many of the primary control plane pods have been recreated and etcd has restarted, which is a good
sign. It looks like weave-net, the CNI that was used to power the networking for this cluster, was not restarted.

Now check the node and see if the kubelet has been upgraded:

```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$ kubectl get nodes

NAME              STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION

ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$ sudo kubelet --version

Kubernetes v1.16.4

ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$
```

Looks like the kubelet is still running on the old version. This shouldn't be a problem right now, since it is still
within one minor version of the kube-apiserver. Still, you will want to upgrade it to ensure future compatibility.


### 6. Finishing the update

At this point, the server and most of the control plane components have been upgraded, leaving the following components:

- The CNI provider plugin (weave net)
- The node's kubelet
- The Kubernetes Client (aka kubectl)

Start with the kubelet and kubectl. Retrieve the kubelet and kubectl binaries that correspond to our cluster from apt:

```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$ sudo apt install kubelet=1.17.2-00 kubectl=1.17.2-00

When upgrading, it is a good idea to declare what versions of the components you want to update to avoid any surprises
during the upgrade process.

When the update completes, check the versions:

```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$ kubectl version

Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"17", GitVersion:"v1.17.2", GitCommit:"59603c6e503c87169aea6106f57b9f242f64df89", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2020-01-18T23:30:10Z", GoVersion:"go1.13.5", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"17", GitVersion:"v1.17.2", GitCommit:"59603c6e503c87169aea6106f57b9f242f64df89", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2020-01-18T23:22:30Z", GoVersion:"go1.13.5", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}

ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$ kubectl get nodes

NAME              STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
ip-172-31-12-52   Ready    master   27h     v1.17.2

ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$
```

Great. Our kubectl client version now matches our API server. We also see that the kubelet now matches the API server version.

> Using apt to update the kubelet will restart it, but you may want to run `sudo systemctl restart kubelet` to manually
> ensure that the kubelet has been properly updated

Next, we'll check the CNI plugin. Depending on when the cluster was bootstrapped, there may have been some changes between
Kubernetes versions. It will be ideal to update the CNI configuration with the latest versions.

Use `kubectl apply` to update the CNI plugin:

```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$ kubectl apply -f \
"https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/net?k8s-version=$(kubectl version | base64 | tr -d '\n')"

serviceaccount/weave-net configured
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/weave-net configured
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/weave-net configured
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/weave-net configured
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/weave-net configured
daemonset.apps/weave-net configured

ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$
```

If a new version of the CNI images or resources have been published, they should be updated. If the cluster was
bootstrapped recently, there may not be any updates.

Check and see if the network CNI pod has updated:

```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system

NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-52:~$
```

In this example, there don't appear to be any updates to the weave-net pods, but our kube-proxy pod is new.

The control plane node has been successfully upgraded from version 1.16.4 to 1.17.2!
